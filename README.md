# General Information

This website is just a training ground. I programm this website alongside learning html, css, javascript and other IT related things. For example, I only created this __README.md__ file to learn and practice _Markdown_. I am german and sometimes my comments are in my native language because it is more precise. I use Arch, btw.

## Examples

### Javascript

I created my own little library. I doesn't contain very advanced stuff but it's very handy and I use it a lot.
This method for example was created for one of my games and I needed it to created objects with random properties.

```javascript
function getRandomBoolean(){
    return Boolean(Math.floor(Math.random() * 2));
}
```
